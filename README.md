## sharedata
[data] a repo for sharing geo-datasets

This dataset collection was inspired by [an article on the new "share economy" companies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2015/03/25/the-big-question-with-uber-airbnb-and-the-rest-of-the-sharing-economy-who-to-sue/), studying how services like Uber and AirBnB affect the topography of our world.

Datasets are predominantly geojson, organized into directories by company or theme. Feel free to download and build maps with these data; source information linked below.
